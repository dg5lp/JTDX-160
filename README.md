# JTDX-Helper-160-2
Although the JTDX-160 not yet released, I prepared a new version running with both JTDX-159 and -160. My first tests showed some serious problems with JTDX-160, especially when logging QSOs. 
All functions are similar to JTDX-Helper-159, but I implemented two new features:
- Prompt-Call list.  Entering wanted stations into this list, the stations will be preferred. It is similar to the "Wanted Call" list, but it is reachable from the main session, even during running S/P operation. Thus no need to open the configuration.
